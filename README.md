## Movie Genre Analysis
### Overview

This project aims to analyze movie genres to provide actionable insights for a new movie studio. By understanding which genres perform the best both domestically and internationally, the studio can make informed decisions about the types of films to produce. The analysis focuses on key performance metrics such as average ratings, number of votes, and gross revenues to identify the most profitable and popular genres.

### Analysis Goals

    Identify the most profitable movie genres based on domestic and foreign gross revenues.
    Understand the distribution of average ratings and number of votes for different genres.
    Provide recommendations on which genres the new movie studio should focus on.

### Methodology

    Data Collection: Gathered data on movies, including genres, average ratings, number of votes, and gross revenues.
    Data Cleaning: Removed outliers and handled missing values to ensure data quality.
    Exploratory Data Analysis:
        Generated visualizations to understand the distribution of average ratings and number of votes by genre.
        Analyzed the total and average gross revenues for each genre.
    Statistical Analysis: Calculated key statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance) for ratings and votes by genre.
